## Level Progression

### Level 1: Beginner's Path
A gentle introduction to the mechanics with forgiving platforms and basic enemies. Perfect for getting familiar with the controls and gameplay.

### Level 2: Intermediate Challenge
Slightly faster gravity and more spaced-out platforms require more precise jumping. Enemies move faster, presenting a greater challenge.

### Level 3: Hard Difficulty
Higher gravity and irregular platform placement test your platforming skills. Introduces colored gems and more aggressive enemies.

### Level 4: Expert Cave System
Features a complex layout with specialized platform types. Navigate moving platforms, bounce across chasms, and traverse narrow ledges in this challenging cave environment.

### Level 5: Master Finale
An epic conclusion featuring:
- Vertical climbing sections
- A precarious bridge of falling platforms
- Moving platforms of increasing speed
- Bouncy platform challenges
- A final gauntlet with boss-like enemies
- The ultimate victory platform that completes your quest!
